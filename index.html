            allows me to leverage my coding expertise but also contributes to the advancement of AI technologies. My 
            proficiency in English and professional experience in explaining abstract concepts and code will ensure I can 
            effectively communicate my findings and contribute to the development of smarter, faster, and safer AI models.
